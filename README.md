# Movie Recommendation System

https://movierecommendationsystem-5.streamlit.app/

## Overview
The **Movie Recommendation System** is a project designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences. It leverages machine learning techniques and data analysis to provide personalized movie recommendations. The system is user-friendly and can be utilized as a standalone application or integrated into larger platforms.

## Features
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on features such as genre, cast, and director.


## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis
  - Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms
    - Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization
- **Framework**: Streamlit (optional, for building an interactive web application)
- **Database**: CSV files or SQL databases for movie data storage

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: Gather movie-related data (e.g., ratings, genres, cast, and crew).
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
3. **Model Building**:
   - Use content-based filtering.
4. **Recommendation**: Provide a ranked list of movie suggestions based on user input.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the script for a web interface, use Streamlit:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```
3. Input user preferences or select movies to get recommendations.

## Dataset
- The dataset used for this project includes movie ratings, genres, and metadata. Public datasets such as **MovieLens** or **IMDb** can be used.

## Future Enhancements
- Include natural language processing (NLP) for analyzing movie reviews.
- Implement deep learning models for more accurate recommendations.
- Add support for real-time recommendations.
- Enhance the UI for better user experience.
